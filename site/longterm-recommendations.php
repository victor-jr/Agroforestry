<h1>Long term: The Lifetime of a Tree or Person</h1>

<a id="plants"></a><h2>ISLAND PLANTS: Ancient traditions, modern adaptability. Keeping people healthy even in climate change.</h2>

<p>Traditional plants of the Marshalls were brought by Island people many centuries ago. They are adapted to atoll conditions: sandy soils and occasional inundation, storms and droughts. They are better able to withstand extreme conditions due to El Niño or climate change than almost any recently introduced species. Traditional and local fruits, vegetables and staple crops provide more vitamins and fiber than imported white rice, white bread, sugar, soda, and fatty meats. They help prevent Vitamin A deficiency, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer. Local plants support rich traditions: ceremonies, traditional medicine, basketry, and art. </p>

<a id="gardening"></a><h2>GARDENING: Plant resilient trees and crops that can <a href="salt-tolerant.php">tolerate drought and salty conditions</a></h2>

<ul>
    <li>Traditional crops that will be strongest (least affected by climate change) in the next 20-40 years are pandanus, coconut, tapioka, giant taro, arrowroot, banana, bele, and citrus. For more detail see this <a href="crop-assessment.php">assessment</a> </li>
    <li>For lists of species that can grow on atolls with different rainfall and salt conditions, download an interactive spreadsheet . Go to the <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/pia/technical/?cid=nrcs142p2_037391#plantmaterials">USDA NRCS website</a> , scroll to “Plant Materials Technical Notes” and click #11 “Coral Atoll Agroforestry Plant Screener.”</li>
    <li>Varieties of pandanus (<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/bob.html">bōb</a>) and breadfruit (<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/ma.html">mā</a>) from the northern atolls can tolerate drought and salinity. Look for productive northern varieties; conserve those varieties; try them in southern islands that may be affected by climate change in the future.</li>
    <li>Giant land taro (<a href=http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/wot.html>wōt</a>) is easier to grow and can tolerate drought and salinity better than true taro (<a href=http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/kotak.html>kōtak</a>) and giant swamp taro (<a href=http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/iaraj.html>iaraj</a>). Varieties of wōt from Fais and other FSM islands might taste better. Ask R&D about introduced varieties!</li>
   <li>Garden crops that do not need groundwater can still be grown even if groundwater becomes saline. These crops include <a href="http://guides.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/paccrops/cassava">cassava</a> (tapioka) and <a href="http://guides.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/paccrops/sweetpotato">sweet potatoes</a>.</li>
   <li>Edible hibiscus (<a href="http://avrdc.org/benefits-bele/">bele</a>) and tree spinach (<a href=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/sustainag/extn_pub/veggie%20pubs/Chaya,%20Spinach%20Tree,%20Chay,%20Kikilchay.pdf>chaya</a>) are nutritious, leafy vegetable shrubs that are fairly tolerant of drier conditions. These species should be replanted by shoots every 2-3 months in partially shaded to open sites. </li>
</ul>

Ask extension agents and experienced farmers about traditional and modern ways of gardening.

<ul>
   <li>Traditional agroforests have many different species, varieties and crops.  This reduces risks because even if some crops fail, maybe the other crops will still produce a harvest. Having a mix of crops at one time (multicropping) or replacing one crop with another (crop rotation) helps reduce damage from insects and diseases</li>
   <li>Mulch and use compost to enrich the soil and help soil retain moisture. Compost farm wastes instead of burning them. Ask R&D for assistance chipping materials to turn into mulch or compost. Some crops grow best under the partial shade of trees.</li>
   <li>Raised beds can tolerate wet conditions and also avoid problems with salinized groundwater</li>
   <li>Improve catchment systems and use irrigation systems.</li>
   <li>Find the best possible location. Planting sites on larger islets generally have more groundwater resources. Planting sites that are inland yet at a higher elevation are further from inundations that may occur. Planting sites on the leeward side or where the reef crest is far from the shore are less likely to be inundated by large waves. These locations are better protected from high sea levels under La Niña conditions, and storms during El Niño conditions.</li>
   <li>For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/301729689/ebac78b829">Mejit</a> looked carefully at which areas were not suitable for breadfruit and which areas were safe</li>

</ul>


<a id="tradition_food"></a><h2>Enjoy TRADITIONAL FOODS that keep you healthy with vitamins and fiber</h2>

<img class="recommendationImg" src="images/TwoBreadfruit-MHaws-2016.jpg"/>

<ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.islandfood.org/">Island foods</a> have many benefits for Culture, Health, Environment, Economy and Food Security. </li>
   <li>In the Marshalls, <a href=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marshall-islands-farming-climate_us_566a0b5ee4b0f290e522ac67>traditional agriculture and healthy eating is a climate change strategy</a>.</li>
   <li>Health and nutrition programs and courses can emphasize cultural pride in traditional food preservation of traditional foods using pandanus (bōb), arrowroot (<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/makmok.html">makmōk</a>) and breadfruit (<a href=http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/ma.html>mā</a>, <a href=http://www.agroforestry.net/images/pdfs/A.mariannensis-dugdug.pdf>mejwaan</a>); new methods of processing and storing nutritious foods; and traditional emergency foods such as lily (<a href=http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/kieb.html>kieb</a>) and Ixora (<a href=http://www.agroforestry.net/images/pdfs/A.mariannensis-dugdug.pdf>kajdo</a>). </li>
   <li>Develop new food processing industries that focus on products based on local staples (arrowroot, breadfruit and pandanus). </li>
</ul>

<a id="coastal_forest"></a><h2>Care for COASTAL FOREST that holds the shoreline and protects crops from salt spray.</h2>

<ul>
   <li>Coastal vegetation is a “natural defense” that can reinforce the shoreline, slow coastal erosion, and reduce the impacts from flooding. Island coastlines are dynamic (always changing) so coastal vegetation will not solve all problems. For a full understanding of coastal change and human actions that can affect it, see “Coastal Change in the Pacific Islands” Volume One [<a href=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/noaa_documents/CoRIS/Coastal_Change_Toolkit_Vol_1_2014.pdf>8 MB</a>] [and the associated <a href=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Coastal%20Change%20Toolkit%20_V2_Final.pdf>toolkit</a>. </li>
   <li>Coastal forest is much easier to protect than to replant. Take care of what is already there! Here is <a href=http://oos.soest.hawaii.edu/pacific-rcc/Marshalls%20Agroforestry/site/coastal-forest.php>guidance</a> for coastal forest in the Marshalls.</li>
</ul>

<a id="longterm_effect"></a><h2>Learn about the long-term effects of climate change in the Marshalls</h2>

<p>What changes will affect agroforestry in the Marshalls and when? We still do not know what choices the world will make and exactly how the air and oceans will change in the long term. Let’s think about what the climate will be during the next forty years, because if we plant a coconut tree now, it will begin to bear fruit soon and will continue to be productive for at least forty years. Forty years allows time for coconuts, breadfruit and other trees to provide crops for children and grandchildren!</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Rainfall likely to increase in El Nino (Year 0) events. Post El Nino effects (Year 1) such as drought will also increase accordingly (4th National Climate Assessment, Box 27.1, figure 27.3)</p></li>

    <li><p>Year to year climate variation will increase as ENSO becomes more unstable and intense. Uncertainty in how these shorter term ENSO variations will combine with multidecadal climate factors (4th National Climate Assessment, Key Message 3: Coastal Communities)</a>.</p></li>

    <li><p>ENSO impacts twice as powerful in 21st century than in 20th century. Amplitude and frequency set to increase with climate change (4th National Climate Assessment, Box 27.1)</p></li>

    <li><p>1 foot in sea level rise by 2050, 4 feet by 2100 (4th National Climate Assessment, Key Message 3 Coastal Communities)</p></li>

    <li><p>Climate change is set to increase the intesity of stressors of agroforests. Prolonged drought, changes in water and soil salinity, wind pattern changes, and pest species increase will all alter the benefits people get from agroforests and the species that are grown within them. Adaptable agroforestry practices will be needed in the future in order to combat these changing variables. (Fourth National Climate Assessment: Chapter 27, Key Message 2: Terrestrial Ecosystems, Services, and Biodiversity. Key Message 5: Indigenous Peoples)</p></li>

    <li><p>Storm intesity is set to increase in the western North Pacific as time goes on and changing El Nino/La Nina patterns. This includes unseasonably strong storms that would have enhanced damage on seasonal agriculture and practices.  (Fourth National Climate Assessment: Chapter 27, Box 27.1 and 27.3)</p></li>

    <li><p>Migration from the outer Marshellese Islands to the main atoll of Majuro has increased because of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion. Additionally the US population of Marshallese increased from 7,000 to 22,000 between 2000 and 2010. Migration as an adaptation strategy is unstudied, but migration from cultural homelands because of climate change can certainly be seen as a negative (Fourth National Climate Assessment: Chapter 27, Case Study: Understanding the Effect of Climate Change on the Migration of Marshallese Islanders)</p></li>

    <li><p>El Nino and La Nina events are projected to increase in both frequency and magnitude as average global temperatures rise. This means more frequent extreme conditions for the Marshall Islands, drought in El Nino years and large rainfall events during La Nina years. (Fourth National Climate Assessment: Chapter 27, Box 27.1 and 27.3) See Cai et al 2015 and 2018 for more information</p></li>
