<h1>Mangroves</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/VegTypes/Mangrove.html">Mangroves</a> are the trees and shrubs that can grow in salt water. In the Marshalls, they are usually found in wet depressions in the centers of islets (<em>pat</em>). They can also grow in sheltered areas below high tide on the shores of islets. Thick mangrove branches and roots help break waves before they reach shore.</p>

<h2>Where and when to plant mangroves</h2>

<p>It is very difficult to restore mangroves.  If you do want to try it, begine where you have a supply of propagules (like seedlings).  Consider planting mangroves where they have grown in the past, and where lagoons are sheltered and shallow.</p>

<h3>Where to plant: different species belong in different zones</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/bulabol.html">Eoeak or Būļaboļ (Rhizophora)</a> is called a <em>fringe</em> species because it grows on the seaward edge of a mangrove forest. Plant this at mean sea level, about halfway between the high tide and low tide points, where it will be inundated by any day’s high tide. If it is an <a href=".">El Niño year</a>, the sea levels might be unusually low, so plant them where it is shallow, because when normal weather returns, the water will be deeper.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/bulabol_(konpat).html">Kōnpat or Būļabōļ (Sonneratia)</a> and <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/jon.html">Joñ (Bruguiera)</a> are usually found in inland swamps (<em>pat</em>) in the Marshalls. You could try planting them closer to shore than the eoeak, where they will be flooded by medium-high tides.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/kimeme.html">Kimeme (Lumnitzera)</a> is called an <em>interior</em> species. It is also mostly found in <em>pat</em>. You can try planting kimeme close to the shoreline, where most high tides will flood it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/kone.html">Kōñe (Pemphis)</a> is a <em>mangrove associate</em> that grows closest to shore but can tolerate flooding by the highest tides. Try planting it closest to shore of all the mangroves.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to plant</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan to do your outplanting soon after a king tide, to allow a few months for seedlings to take root before the next king tide. Tide charts are available at (click here)</li>
<li>Don't plan a planting project during the stormy season of an El Niño Year 0.  Postpone your outplanting day if inundations are predicted by local radio.  Sea levels over the coming week, based on tides and wave trains (but not including local tropical storms and tsunamis), are shown <a href="http://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/dashboard_RMI/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical advice on planting mangroves</h3>

<p>Pages 39-42 of the <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Coastal%20Change%20Toolkit%20_V2_Final.pdf">”Coastal Change Toolkit”</a> provides basic advice in the context of other options for coastal management.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.mangroverestoration.com/pdfs/mangrove_restoration.pdf">“Mangrove Restoration” pamphlet</a> gives practical advice from Indonesia, where foresters have successfully planted the same mangrove species as are found in the Marshalls.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationPractices/Marine/crr/library/Documents/MangrovesforCoastalDefence_Decision_makers_Guide_WebVersion.pdf">“Decision Makers’ Guide”</a> offers more considerations about mangroves for coastal defense worldwide.</p>

<h2>Case study – Outplanting mangroves in atolls of Chuuk</h2>

<p><em>Recommendations from <a href="acknowledgements.php">Sleeper Sared</a></em></p>

<p>On three atoll islets, Sleeper planted mangroves along the lagoon-side shore in a strip one mile long. He planted four rows, with seedlings 2–3 feet apart. He gathered the propagules (sprouted seeds) locally and planted them directly into the sand or sediment. After one year, 75% (three quarters) were surviving. Sleeper says seagrass is an indicator of sufficiently calm waters with enough sediment.</p>
<p>On another atoll islet, the mangroves all died, because the currents were too strong.</p>
<p>Sleeper says: If there is a current and not enough sediment to hold the propagules when they are planted, put out rocks or wire boxes filled with rocks. Wait for sediments to be deposited by the currents. Plant propagules into the accumulated sediments.</p>
<p>Sleeper says: Another technique for areas without much sediment is to use heavy paper bags such as cement sacks or some rice sacks. (Ordinary paper bags are not strong enough.) Fill the bags with sand and seaweed and plant propagules in them in a nursery. They are ready after they take root in the sacks, but before roots burst through sacks and root in the ground. Outplant them in holes dug into sediment or in niches between rocks.</p>
